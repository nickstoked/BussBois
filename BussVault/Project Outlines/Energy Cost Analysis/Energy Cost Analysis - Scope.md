## Statement of Purpose
---
The purpose of this project is to correlate the energy cost in cents/kWh with various location, census, and demographic data to identify insights on the cost of electricity in the US. 

We will cross reference various data sets in attempts to correlate various factors and learn from those relationships. For example: 
- Cost vs State Population
- Cost vs Population Density
- Cost vs Political leanings/Representation
- Cost vs Demographic
- Cost vs % rural or city dwelling
- Cost vs Household Income
- Cost vs Interconnection

	4. Demographic Information
	5. Political Climate or Representation
	6. Grid Interconnection States List
2. Data Cleanup
3. Comparison and data visualization
